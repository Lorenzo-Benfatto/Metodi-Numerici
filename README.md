# Metodi-Numerici
A repository for the programs I wrote in the course of Numerical Methods for theoretical physics.
Every folder is supposed to display all the code necessary to do the stuff it's supposed to do.
If it doesn't work then it's just how the entirety of my life goes, where I try to make things right and end up with a fucked up mess that's worse than before.
