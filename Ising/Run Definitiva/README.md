In this folder there are all the files necessary to complete the Module.
\\
One needs to (in order):
\\
modify simulatore_boot.h for the different lattice measures
\\
simulatore_boot.c (it needs beta.txt and MODIFY init.txt)
\\
ising_bootstrappato.c
\\
analisiboot.py (optional, just to watch the energy plot)
\\
Plot_C-Chi.py
\\
fit_exp_crit
\\
ciclo_plot.py (to plot different lattice data in the same figure)
\\
roba FSS non ancora fatta
\\
In order to look at the physical situation of polarized spins, one can also run Plot3d.py
\\
All the others .h are necessary for the programs to work
