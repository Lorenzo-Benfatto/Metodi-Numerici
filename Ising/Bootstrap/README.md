This folder contains the state of the art of the data simulation techniques that we employed. The data simulated this way through the Metropolis are bootstrapped in an astonishingly low time to obtain peak performance.
Various lattice measures are considered and supposedly those are the data on which we are going to do the analysis for the exam.
I don't even know who I am writing this documentation for, honestly. It's not like anybody is ever going to dig that deep in this project and not even my collaborators take the time to read my nonsense.
